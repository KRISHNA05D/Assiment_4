    "Encapsulation: This is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together as a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: This involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Abstraction allows a programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level rather than the nitty-gritty details of the implementation. It is often implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. The existing class is known as the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if the method name is the same. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism). It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions, making it easier to manage and extend code."
